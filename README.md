# activitystreams2-extensions

This repository is to track extensions to the [ActivityStreams 2.0 Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/).

Extensions in this repository will claim URLs at https://extensions.activitystreams2.com/ 

## Usage

[./work-in-progress/](./work-in-progress) - Thinking of starting to define a new extension? Create a directory in here to claim a name (e.g. ./work-in-progress/yourname/dating/). Add files in the directory explaining your goals with the extension.

[./extensions/](./extensions) - Extensions that have been developed far enough to have clear documentation, examples, accountable editors, and are ready to request implementation from a broader community.
